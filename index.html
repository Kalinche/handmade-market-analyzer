  <h1>Welcome to My Etsy Integration</h1>
  <p>This application may be used by artists who are new to selling their products online. The idea is to help them collect useful information about the current state of the market - which products are most wanted, what are the prices, etc. This may be useful for them as a market analysis that will direct them to the right decisions when it comes to improving their product ideas.</p>
